Intrusion Detection using YOLOR Algorithm

Overview

This repository showcases an innovative intrusion detection system based on the YOLOR (You Only Look Once Representation) algorithm. The primary objective of this project is to enhance security and detect potential intrusions in real-time, enabling timely responses to mitigate security risks.

YOLOR Algorithm

YOLOR is an advanced object detection algorithm, combining the principles of You Only Look Once (YOLO) and Re-Score. It excels in real-time detection of multiple objects, including unauthorized entities attempting to breach security perimeters.

Dataset

To train and evaluate the intrusion detection model, we curated a diverse dataset comprising images and corresponding labels indicating the presence of intrusions. The dataset has been carefully annotated to ensure accurate training and reliable performance.
